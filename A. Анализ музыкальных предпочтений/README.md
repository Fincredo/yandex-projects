# Analysis of musical preferences

_Basic Python Module_


## Project goal

Using data from an online music service to compare the behavior of Moscow and St. Petersburg users: the dependence of the users’ activity on day of week, as well as their preferences for music genres.


## Project description

Based on the data provided by the Yandex.Music service, it is necessary to compare the behavior of users of the two capitals. 
The aim of the study is to test three hypotheses:
  1.	The user activity in Moscow and St. Petersburg depends on day of week, and in different ways.
  2.	Monday mornings in Moscow and St. Petersburg are dominated by different musical genres. The same is true for Friday evenings.
  3.	In general, in Moscow people listen to pop music more often, and in St. Petersburg people more often listen to Russian rap.


## Work stages

1.	Data research
2.	Data preprocessing (header style, omissions, full and implicit duplicates)
3.	Hypothesis testing (user activity, genres at the beginning and at end of week, genres popular in both capitals)
4.	Results of the research


## Results

All three hypotheses were tested, the first of which was fully confirmed, the second was partially confirmed, and the third was not confirmed.
